Skywalker is a package to allow one to concurrently go through a filesystem with ease.

## Features

- Concurrency
- BlackList filtering
- WhiteList filtering
- Filter by Directory
- Filter by Extension
- Glob Filtering (provided by [gobwas/glob](https://github.com/gobwas/glob))

> For matching to work properly across platforms. Please use `/`. In [gobwas/glob](https://github.com/gobwas/glob) the `\` is an escape character (so you can escape `*`, `?`, etc...) making it difficult to know if you want to escape a character or go into directory.

## Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sort"
    "strings"
    "sync"

    "github.com/dixonwille/skywalker"
)

type ExampleWorker struct {
    *sync.Mutex
    found []string
}

func (ew *ExampleWorker) Work(path string) {
    //This is where the necessary work should be done.
    //This will get concurrently so make sure it is thread safe if you need info across threads.
    ew.Lock()
    defer ew.Unlock()
    ew.found = append(ew.found, path)
}

func main() {
    //Following two functions are only to create and destroy data for the example
    defer teardownData()
    standupData()

    ew := new(ExampleWorker)
    ew.Mutex = new(sync.Mutex)

    //root is the root directory of the data that was stood up above
    sw := skywalker.New(root, ew)
    sw.DirListType = skywalker.LTBlacklist
    sw.DirList = []string{"sub"}
    sw.ExtListType = skywalker.LTWhitelist
    sw.ExtList = []string{".pdf"}
    err := sw.Walk()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }
    sort.Sort(sort.StringSlice(ew.found))
    for _, f := range ew.found {
        fmt.Println(strings.Replace(f, sw.Root, "", 1))
    }
}
```
